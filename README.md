## What is PromptPanel?

**PromptPanel** is an open-source, **native macOS prompt manager** and snippet launcher designed for the way AI power users actually work. Press a global hotkey from anywhere — ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, VS Code, your terminal, your browser — and a lightweight panel slides in. Type a few characters, hit `Enter`, and the entry lands in your current input box. No account. No cloud. No syncing service. Everything stays on your Mac.

If you've been hunting for an **AI prompt library**, a **TextExpander alternative for prompts**, an **open-source snippet launcher for macOS**, or a way to stop pasting the same instructions into Claude and ChatGPT a hundred times a day — that is exactly what PromptPanel does.

## Does this sound familiar?

PromptPanel exists because the same five problems show up every day for anyone working with LLMs:

- You retype the same **role / system prompt** ("you are a senior staff engineer…") into a fresh ChatGPT or Claude chat ten times a day.
- You keep a Notes app or scratchpad full of **AI prompts and code-review checklists** and `⌘+F` your way through it.
- You finally find the right prompt and the **paste fails silently** because focus moved or the app blocked synthetic keystrokes.
- Your **Cursor / Copilot project context block** is in one file, the **terminal command snippet** in another, and the **PR-review prompt** in a third — none searchable from one place.
- You won't put a real client brief or proprietary architecture into a **cloud prompt manager**, so you end up with no prompt manager at all.

PromptPanel collapses all of that into a single, sub-second loop with a local SQLite file you fully own.

## Why PromptPanel?

Most "prompt managers" are either browser extensions (locked to one site), or generic snippet tools that weren't built for the AI workflow. PromptPanel is purpose-built around one short loop:

> **hotkey → search → enter → content lands in the active input field**

Everything else is in service of making that loop fast, predictable, and never lossy.

| You want… | PromptPanel gives you |
|---|---|
| A prompt library that works **across every app**, not just one website | Global hotkey, native macOS panel, works in any text field |
| **Speed** — sub-second from keypress to typing | < 300 ms hotkey-to-focus target, < 100 ms search refresh target, < 250 ms execution target |
| **Project isolation** so client A's prompts don't leak into client B | First-class projects + a built-in `Universal` project for shared content |
| **No cloud lock-in** for sensitive prompts | Local SQLite. Zero network calls for core features. Your data is a single file you own |
| **Auto-paste that doesn't silently fail** | Auto-paste first, clipboard fallback always — and a clear toast if paste was blocked |
| **Keyboard-only operation** | Summon → type → arrow-keys → Enter. Mouse never required |
| Open source you can audit, fork, and trust | MIT license, plain Swift, no telemetry |

## Who is it for?

- **Heavy ChatGPT / Claude / Gemini users** who reuse the same role definitions, output-format constraints, and context blocks
- **Cursor / Copilot / Aider users** who paste the same architecture summaries and review checklists
- **Developers** who repeatedly type commit-message scaffolds, code review templates, terminal commands, error-triage snippets
- **Indie hackers and consultants** juggling multiple client projects with different style guides and tone-of-voice rules
- **Technical writers and PMs** who maintain reusable replies, status updates, and spec scaffolds

If "I copy and paste the same multiline prompt twenty times a day" describes you, this tool was written for you.

## Features

### Core (v1.0)

- 🔥 **Global hotkey** — summon the panel from any foreground app, configurable shortcut
- ⚡ **< 300 ms time-to-input** — `NSPanel`-based, no Electron, no web runtime, no cold start
- 🔍 **Instant search** across title and body, no submit step
- 🗂️ **Projects** — isolate prompts per client, repo, or context; `Universal` project always visible
- 📋 **Auto-paste with clipboard fallback** — uses `CGEvent` to send ⌘V, falls back gracefully if Accessibility permission is missing
- 🎯 **Keyboard-first** — arrow keys to navigate, Enter to execute, Esc to dismiss
- 📌 **Pin & sort** — pin frequent entries, manual sort, then by recency, then by usage count
- 🌗 **Light / dark / system** theme
- 🪶 **Menu-bar resident** — out of the way until you summon it
- 🚀 **Launch at login** via `SMAppService`
- 🔐 **Permission-aware degradation** — without Accessibility, you still get one-key copy and a clear UI hint
- 📝 **Multiline content** — full template bodies, no length limit on storage
- 📊 **Execution log** for diagnosing paste failures
- 🔄 **Auto-update** via Sparkle (you can disable it)

### Explicitly *not* doing (project boundaries)

By design PromptPanel will **never** add cloud sync, team collaboration, or complex workflow orchestration. These are not "later" — they are out of scope forever. The tool is a single-user, local-only utility, and that is the point. See [PRD §4.2](docs/项目快贴-PRD.md) for the rationale.

## How does it work?

```
   ┌──────────────┐    hotkey     ┌──────────────┐    select    ┌──────────────┐
   │  any app     │  ──────────►  │ PromptPanel  │  ──────────► │  clipboard   │
   │ (ChatGPT,    │   (global)    │  NSPanel     │   (Enter)    │   (write)    │
   │  Claude,     │               │              │              └──────┬───────┘
   │  Cursor…)    │ ◄──────────── │              │                     │
   └──────────────┘  paste / focus└──────────────┘                     │
          ▲                         restored                            │
          └────────── CGEvent ⌘V (Accessibility permission) ◄───────────┘
                          fallback: clipboard only + toast
```

1. You press the configured hotkey (`KeyboardShortcuts` library captures it system-wide).
2. PromptPanel snaps an `NSPanel` over the active window, focuses the search field, and shows entries from the current project plus the `Universal` project, sorted by pin → manual → recency → usage count.
3. You type to filter (live, no submit), arrow to choose, press `Enter`.
4. The selected content is **always** written to the system clipboard first (this is the guarantee — clipboard never silently fails).
5. The panel hides, the previous app regains focus, and PromptPanel synthesizes a `⌘V` via `CGEvent`. If Accessibility permission is missing or the target app blocks synthetic events, a toast tells you "Copied — press ⌘V to paste."
6. Execution is logged locally so you can diagnose any per-app paste issue later.

This separation — **clipboard as guarantee, auto-paste as best-effort** — is the single most important design decision in the project.

## Installation

> **System requirement:** macOS 14 (Sonoma) or later. Apple Silicon and Intel both supported.

### Option A — Build from source (current path while pre-release)

```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/tytsxai/PromptPanel.git
cd PromptPanel

# 2. Build the .app bundle (signed ad-hoc by default)
./scripts/build-app.sh

# 3. Move it into Applications (or run from dist/)
open dist/PromptPanel.app
```

Requirements for building:

- Xcode 15+ with the macOS 14 SDK
- Swift 5.10 toolchain (`xcrun swift --version`)

### Option B — Signed & notarized release

Once a tagged release is published, a notarized `.dmg` will be attached. Until then, build locally — it takes ~30 seconds on Apple Silicon.

### First-run setup

1. **Grant Accessibility permission** when prompted. macOS uses this to allow synthetic `⌘V` keystrokes. Without it, PromptPanel still copies to clipboard reliably; you just paste manually.
2. **Set your hotkey** in Settings → Hotkey. The current default is `⌥2`; pick another shortcut if it conflicts with your setup.
3. **Create a project** or start adding entries to `Universal`.

## Quick start

```text
1. ⌥2              → panel appears, search field focused
2. type "review"   → filters to your code-review prompt
3. ↵               → content pasted into the active text field
4. (panel hides)   → keep working
```

You can switch the active project from inside the panel without opening the main window — keyboard-only, no detour.

## Configuration

| Setting | Where | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Global hotkey | Settings → Hotkey | One shortcut. Toggle behavior: same key dismisses |
| Theme | Settings → Appearance | Light / dark / follow system |
| Launch at login | Settings → General | Uses `SMAppService` |
| Auto-update | Settings → Updates | Powered by Sparkle 2; can be disabled |
| Database location | `~/Library/Application Support/PromptPanel/promptpanel.db` | Single-file SQLite, easy to back up |
| Logs | `~/Library/Logs/PromptPanel/` | Inspected via the main window's "Runtime Health" |

## Privacy & data

- **Local-first by definition.** Your prompts live in a single SQLite file on your Mac. The app does not POST your content anywhere.
- **No telemetry.** No analytics SDKs, no metrics endpoints, no crash reporting service.
- **Network access** is limited to Sparkle's update check (a single signed-feed fetch, opt-out in Settings).
- **No accounts.** There is nothing to sign in to.
- **Open source.** Audit `Sources/PromptPanel/Core/` to verify any of the above.

If your prompts contain proprietary information — internal architecture, client briefs, NDA-bound context — this is exactly the property you want.

## How does PromptPanel compare to alternatives?

> Quick orientation, not a takedown. These tools are good at what they do.

| | **PromptPanel** | TextExpander | Espanso | Raycast Snippets | Alfred Snippets | Browser prompt extensions |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Open source | ✅ MIT | ❌ | ✅ GPLv3 | Partial | ❌ | varies |
| macOS native (no Electron / web runtime) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Works in any app (not just browser) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Quick-search panel UI (not just trigger strings) | ✅ | partial | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | varies |
| Project / context isolation | ✅ first-class | groups | folders | folders | folders | rare |
| Keyboard-only flow | ✅ | partial | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | varies |
| Local-only / no cloud option | ✅ default | optional, paid tiers nudge cloud | ✅ | account required | ✅ | usually cloud |
| Free | ✅ | $$$ | ✅ | freemium | requires Powerpack | varies |
| Built specifically around AI prompt workflow | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ but browser-only |

**TL;DR:** if you live in the browser only, a browser extension is fine. If you live in Cursor/VS Code/Terminal/Slack/everywhere, you want something native and panel-based. Among native panel-based options, PromptPanel is the open-source, AI-prompt-shaped one.

## Workflow examples

Concrete ways people use PromptPanel day-to-day — these double as the long-tail "how do I..." questions PromptPanel is built to answer.

- **Spin up a fresh ChatGPT / Claude chat with your standard role / system prompt.** Hotkey → type `role` → Enter. No more retyping "You are a senior staff engineer who..." for the 200th time.
- **Drop a Cursor / Copilot project-context block into a new file.** Have a multi-paragraph "here is the architecture, conventions, and constraints" block stored once; paste into any new Cursor session with one keystroke.
- **Paste a code-review checklist into a PR draft.** Long bulleted checklist lives in PromptPanel; one hotkey appends it to a GitHub PR description.
- **Fire a repeating terminal command with the exact flag combo.** `kubectl get pods --context=prod --namespace=… -o jsonpath=…` — typed once, stored, summoned by short search string.
- **Insert a meeting-notes template into Notion / Obsidian / Apple Notes.** Same template every Monday standup → one hotkey, zero copy-paste from a Notes app scratchpad.
- **Push a customer-service / sales reply template into Slack or email.** Different tone per template, picked from a quick-search panel rather than a Notes folder.
- **Switch between projects with isolated prompt sets.** Each project group keeps its own role prompts, snippets, and templates so context never bleeds across clients.

## Tech stack

- **Language:** Swift 5.10
- **UI:** AppKit (`NSPanel`, `NSStatusItem`) + SwiftUI
- **Storage:** SQLite via [GRDB.swift](https://github.com/groue/GRDB.swift)
- **Hotkey:** [sindresorhus/KeyboardShortcuts](https://github.com/sindresorhus/KeyboardShortcuts) (Carbon Hot Key under the hood)
- **Auto-paste:** `CGEvent` synthesizing ⌘V after focus restoration
- **Login item:** `SMAppService`
- **Updater:** [Sparkle 2](https://sparkle-project.org/)
- **Distribution:** Developer ID + Apple notarization (no Mac App Store)
- **Build:** Swift Package Manager — no Xcode project required

## Roadmap

PromptPanel follows a **deliberately small** roadmap. The PRD lists items that are explicitly off the table forever (cloud sync, teams, workflow orchestration). Within scope:

- [x] v1.0 — main link complete: hotkey → search → execute, projects, clipboard fallback, light/dark, login item, Sparkle, signing & notarization scripts
- [ ] One-tap "repeat last entry"
- [ ] JSON / Markdown import & export
- [ ] Variable templates (`{{name}}` style) — only if it can be added without slowing the main link

See [docs/路线图与贡献指南.md](docs/路线图与贡献指南.md) for prioritization rules, [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for what's shipped, and [issues](https://github.com/tytsxai/PromptPanel/issues) for public planning.

## Frequently asked questions

For a longer FAQ, see [FAQ.md](docs/FAQ.md). The greatest hits:

### Is PromptPanel free?

Yes. MIT license. No paid tier, no usage cap, no account.

### Does it work with Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4)?

Yes — it builds as a universal binary. Tested on both Apple Silicon and Intel macOS 14+.

### Does it send my prompts anywhere?

No. The only network call is the Sparkle update feed, which fetches release metadata only and can be turned off in Settings. Your prompt content never leaves your Mac.

### Why does it ask for Accessibility permission?

To synthesize a `⌘V` keystroke after the panel hides and your previous app regains focus. Without this permission the app still works — it just stops at the clipboard step and shows you a "press ⌘V to paste" toast.

### Will you add cloud sync / team sharing / workflows?

No, deliberately. Those are listed as **permanent non-goals** in the [PRD §4.2](docs/项目快贴-PRD.md). The product's identity is "single-user, local-only, fast." Adding any of those would change what the product is.

### Why not Electron / Tauri?

The hottest paths in this product (global hotkey timing, focus restoration, synthetic keystroke injection, accessibility permission flow) are macOS system-integration concerns. A cross-platform shell adds latency and indirection without buying any features that matter for this product. See [docs/技术选型.md](docs/技术选型.md) for the full reasoning.

### How do I report a bug or request a feature?

Open an issue: <https://github.com/tytsxai/PromptPanel/issues>. Please use the templates — they'll save us both round-trips.

### How do I import my existing prompts from another tool?

Import is on the roadmap; for now you can write directly to the SQLite file or paste entries into the main window. PRs that add a clean importer for TextExpander / Espanso / Raycast format are very welcome.

## Contributing

PRs welcome — please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) first. Two non-obvious rules:

1. **UI changes must align with `frontend-draft/`.** That directory is the source of truth for visuals; don't ship a Swift view that contradicts the JSX mockup.
2. **Stay inside the PRD's scope.** If a proposal would push the product toward cloud / teams / workflows, it's a "no" regardless of how well-implemented it is. This isn't gatekeeping — it's the reason the tool is fast and trustworthy.
