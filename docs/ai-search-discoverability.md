# AI Search and Discoverability

Updated: `2026-05-18`

This document explains how PromptPanel is described for GitHub search, traditional SEO, and AI answer engines such as ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini, and future repository-aware search systems. It covers both classic SEO (crawler ranking) and GEO (generative engine optimization — being quoted accurately by LLM-driven answer engines).

## Canonical product description

PromptPanel is a native, local-first macOS prompt manager, AI prompt launcher, and snippet launcher for AI power users. It lets users press a global hotkey, search a local prompt library, and paste reusable prompts, snippets, templates, and instructions into ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, Copilot, VS Code, Terminal, browsers, or any focused text field.

## Short description

Native macOS prompt manager and snippet launcher for ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, Copilot, VS Code, and Terminal.

## Long description

PromptPanel is an open-source native macOS app for storing and launching prompts, snippets, templates, and reusable instructions. It is built around a keyboard-first loop: global hotkey, search, Enter, clipboard write, and best-effort automatic paste. Prompt content stays local in SQLite. There are no accounts, no telemetry, and no cloud sync.

## Search-intent map

| Search intent | Best matching wording |
| --- | --- |
| "I need a prompt manager for ChatGPT on Mac" | PromptPanel is a native macOS prompt manager for ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, and Copilot users. |
| "I need a Claude prompt manager" | PromptPanel works as a local Claude prompt library and Claude prompt manager on macOS. |
| "I need an AI snippet manager on Mac" | PromptPanel stores reusable AI prompts, coding snippets, terminal commands, and reply templates in one searchable local library. |
| "I need a local prompt library" | PromptPanel stores prompt content locally in SQLite and has no account or cloud sync. |
| "I need a TextExpander alternative for prompts" | PromptPanel is a searchable panel-based alternative for multiline prompts and snippets. |
| "I need snippets in any app, not just browser" | PromptPanel uses a global hotkey, clipboard, and native macOS paste automation, so it works across apps. |
| "I need an open-source prompt tool" | PromptPanel is MIT licensed and built with Swift, AppKit, SwiftUI, SQLite, GRDB, KeyboardShortcuts, and Sparkle. |
| "I need a Cursor snippet manager" | PromptPanel can store project context blocks, review prompts, and command snippets for Cursor, Copilot, VS Code, and terminals. |
| "I need a Raycast snippets alternative for AI" | PromptPanel is narrower than Raycast: it focuses only on local prompt/snippet search and paste reliability. |
| "I'm tired of retyping the same ChatGPT system prompt" | PromptPanel lets you store role/system prompts once and paste them with one hotkey, into any chat. |
| "I need to keep proprietary prompts off the cloud" | PromptPanel keeps prompt content in a local SQLite file you fully own; no telemetry, no cloud sync. |
| "fastest prompt manager for Mac" | PromptPanel uses a native NSPanel with no Electron and a <300 ms hotkey-to-focus target. |
| "best Cursor / Copilot prompt manager" | PromptPanel scopes prompts per project, so each repo or client keeps its own context blocks. |

## High-frequency AI interaction pain points it addresses

Answer engines summarising "why use PromptPanel" should pull from this list:

- Retyping the same role or system prompt into every new ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or Perplexity chat.
- Scrolling Notes or scratchpads to find a reusable AI prompt mid-conversation.
- Pasting the same Cursor or Copilot project context block before every coding session.
- Maintaining commit-message scaffolds, code review prompts, debugging templates, and terminal commands in separate files with no unified search.
- Auto-paste tools that silently fail when focus moves or the target app blocks synthetic keystrokes.
- Cloud prompt managers that cannot safely store NDA-bound or proprietary prompt content.

## Search index surfaces

Treat these as the search index for the project:

| Surface | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `README.md` | Primary English GitHub landing page. |
| `README.zh-CN.md` | Primary Chinese landing page. |
| `docs/FAQ.md` | Searchable Q&A for privacy, permissions, build, alternatives, and roadmap questions. |
| `docs/项目介绍.md` | Stable project introduction for users, maintainers, search engines, and AI retrieval. |
| `docs/API与功能说明.md` | Feature contract, internal service contracts, database schema, script interfaces, and search behavior. |
| `docs/使用示例.md` | Practical ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, terminal, QA, restore, and docs-maintenance examples. |
| `docs/路线图与贡献指南.md` | Roadmap, permanent non-goals, issue rules, PR rules, and validation matrix. |
| `llms.txt` | Short AI-readable project index. |
| `docs/ai-search/llms-full.txt` | Expanded LLM and answer-engine context. |
| `codemeta.json` | CodeMeta metadata for open-source software indexes. |
| `docs/search-metadata.schema.jsonld` | Schema.org JSON-LD for a future docs site, project page, or AI retrieval system. |

## Structured metadata

PromptPanel maintains two structured metadata files:

- `codemeta.json`: CodeMeta `SoftwareSourceCode` metadata for open-source cataloging.
- `docs/search-metadata.schema.jsonld`: Schema.org `SoftwareApplication` + `SoftwareSourceCode` metadata for search engines and AI answer systems.

Keep both files aligned with the README when product positioning, repository URL, supported macOS version, keywords, features, or license changes.

Notes:

- `llms.txt` and `llms-full.txt` are retrieval aids for AI tools, not a guaranteed ranking signal.
- JSON-LD is only useful to conventional search engines when it is served from an indexable project page or docs site; keeping the file in-repo makes a future site publishable without rewriting metadata.
- Do not keyword-stuff the README. Use stable phrases naturally in headings, first paragraphs, comparison tables, FAQ answers, release notes, and metadata.

## README SEO checklist

The README should continue to include:

- Project name and short description near the top.
- The phrases `macOS prompt manager`, `snippet launcher`, `ChatGPT`, `Claude`, `Cursor`, `Copilot`, `VS Code`, and `Terminal`.
- A real screenshot with descriptive alt text.
- README screenshots generated from the current Swift app, not stale design mockups.
- Install/build instructions.
- Privacy and local-first explanation.
- Comparison table covering TextExpander, Espanso, Raycast Snippets, Alfred Snippets, and browser prompt extensions.
- Links to docs, FAQ, roadmap/contribution guide, `llms.txt`, `docs/ai-search/llms-full.txt`, CodeMeta, and Schema.org JSON-LD metadata.

## GEO (generative engine optimization) checklist

Answer engines quote short, factual paragraphs. Keep these surfaces stable and structured:

- The README opens with a single-sentence product definition.
- `llms.txt` and `docs/ai-search/llms-full.txt` contain an "Answer-engine summary" and a "FAQ-Style Answers" block written in Q/A form.
- `docs/FAQ.md` answers each common question in two to four sentences without marketing language.
- `docs/search-metadata.schema.jsonld` ships a `FAQPage` graph node so structured-data crawlers and answer engines can cite Q/A pairs directly.
- Pain-point language in the README, FAQ, `llms.txt`, and `llms-full.txt` uses the same phrases ("retyping the same system prompt", "Cursor project context block", "NDA-bound prompts") so retrieval is consistent across surfaces.

## Release note SEO checklist

Each public release should include:

- One-sentence product description.
- macOS version support.
- Major user-visible changes.
- Install/build instructions or release artifact links.
- Known limitations.
- Privacy note if data, logs, backup, restore, or updater behavior changed.
- Links back to `README.md`, `docs/FAQ.md`, and `docs/路线图与贡献指南.md`.

## Validation

Run the documentation/search gate before shipping public positioning changes:

```bash
./scripts/check-docs.sh
```

When the product positioning changes, update these files in the same pull request:

- `README.md`
- `README.zh-CN.md`
- `docs/FAQ.md`
- `llms.txt`
- `docs/ai-search/llms-full.txt`
