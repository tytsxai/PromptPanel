# PromptPanel Documentation

Updated: `2026-05-07`

This documentation set is now part of the public open-source repository. It is intended to let a new maintainer understand, build, verify, release, troubleshoot, and extend PromptPanel without relying on private handoff notes.

PromptPanel is a native, local-first macOS prompt manager and snippet launcher. The key workflow is:

```text
global hotkey -> quick panel -> search -> execute -> clipboard guarantee -> automatic paste when allowed
```

Chinese-language handoff docs are intentionally kept because the original product definition and maintainer notes are Chinese. The root README and FAQ provide the English public entry layer.

## Repository Entry Points

- [Root README](../README.md): public product overview and build instructions.
- [Chinese README](../README.zh-CN.md): Chinese public product overview.
- [FAQ](../FAQ.md): search-friendly explanations for common user questions.
- [llms.txt](../llms.txt): short machine-readable project index.
- [llms-full.txt](../llms-full.txt): expanded LLM context.
- [codemeta.json](../codemeta.json): structured open-source software metadata.
- [Schema.org JSON-LD](./search-metadata.schema.jsonld): structured metadata for search engines and AI retrieval systems.
- [PRD](../项目快贴-PRD.md): product scope and permanent non-goals.
- [Contributing](../CONTRIBUTING.md): contribution rules and validation expectations.
- [Security](../SECURITY.md): private reporting and local-data boundaries.

## Current System Facts

- Runtime shape: local macOS desktop app only.
- Source root: `Sources/PromptPanel`.
- Tests: `Tests/PromptPanelTests`.
- UI source of truth: `frontend-draft/`.
- Build and release scripts: `scripts/`.
- CI: `.github/workflows/macos-release-readiness.yml`.
- Docs gate: `scripts/check-docs.sh`, also run by `scripts/release-readiness.sh` and CI.
- Local database: `~/Library/Application Support/PromptPanel/promptpanel.db`.
- Logs: `~/Library/Logs/PromptPanel/`.
- Core guarantee: selected content is written to clipboard before automatic paste is attempted.
- Accessibility permission is required only for automatic paste, not for clipboard fallback.

After any code, script, CI, packaging, config, or UI-baseline change, run:

```bash
./scripts/check-docs.sh
```

This is not a full semantic proof, but it catches the failures that have caused real drift here: missing handoff pages, broken local links, undocumented `PROMPTPANEL_*` knobs, stale database names, old hotkey text, machine-local paths, missing AI-search metadata, and disconnected README/docs/llms entry points.

## First-Day Maintainer Checklist

1. Run `git status --short` to understand local drift.
2. Run `./scripts/check-docs.sh`.
3. Run `swift build`.
4. Run `swift test` if the host has full XCTest support. If the host lacks `xctest`, use the documented build-only readiness path and say so.
5. Run `./scripts/release-readiness.sh --output-dir /tmp/promptpanel-ready-check` for release-oriented validation.
6. Build the `.app` with `./scripts/build-app.sh` and smoke test the packaged app, not only the command-line binary.
7. Check the main window's Runtime Health and recent execution logs after a real paste test.

## Boundaries To Preserve

- PromptPanel is a local macOS client, not a server product.
- Containers and ordinary servers can host release files, but they do not run the product.
- Clipboard write is the reliability guarantee; automatic paste is a best-effort convenience.
- Database corruption recovery and schema migration failure are different incident classes.
- Cloud sync, team collaboration, and workflow orchestration remain permanent non-goals.
